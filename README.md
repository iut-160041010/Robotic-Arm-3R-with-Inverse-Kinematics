# Robotic-Arm-3R-with-Inverse-Kinematics

The project is to basically a test whether the formulas we derived and gathered for inverse kinematics of a 3r robotic arm works or not. 
we used 3servo motors for the arm. the arm was made of pvc. 
the formulas were derived using geometry and trigonometry.
First the arm model was simulated in matlab where inverse kinematics is applied. then we made an arm out of pvc pieces and applied. The formula correctly generated correct servo motor angles for given (x,y,z) coordinates.
