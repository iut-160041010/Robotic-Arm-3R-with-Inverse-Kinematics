# Robotic-Arm-3R-with-Inverse-Kinematics

The project is to basically a test whether the formulas we derived and gathered for inverse kinematics of a 3r robotic arm works or not. 
we used 3servo motors for the arm. the arm was made of pvc. 
the formulas were derived using geometry and trigonometry.
